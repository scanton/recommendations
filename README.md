# recommendations

This is an extremely simple demonstration of how to create a product recommendation system with [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js).

This repository goes with an article on Medium called [“Creating a Product Recommendation Neural Network in the Web Browser”](https://medium.com/@satoricanton/creating-a-product-recommendation-neural-network-in-the-web-browser-30129fca4c21).

To install this example, clone this repository to your local machine, navigate your terminal or command line interface to the folder you cloned this repository to and type the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the application dependencies are installed, you can run the application in the terminal with:

```bash
npm start
```
